Given several observations of a vector x, of dimension d,
provided by one or more fmatrix files,
this program computes the pearson correlation.

The program computes the covarianze matrix (d x d)
  cov = E{(x-mu) (x-m)^T }

and the pearson or the normalized covarianze
  cov(i,j) = cov(i,j)/ (stdev(i) * stdev(j))

Both matrixes can be optionally save (in text or binary form).

Then, it prints, for each coefficient, the components with highter 
pearson value.

E.g.:

Feature 0
-0.524439	rho[0][6]
0.314953	rho[0][1]
-0.249641	rho[0][7]
-0.200226	rho[0][8]
../..
Feature 1
-0.399633	rho[1][6]
0.350754	rho[1][2]
0.314953	rho[1][0]
../..


The highest correation of x[0] is x[6], coef. -0.5244; then x[1], etc.
Then, for x[1], highest correlation is with x[6], ...
